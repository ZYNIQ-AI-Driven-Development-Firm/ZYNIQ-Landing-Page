# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Updated @react-three/fiber to v9.0.0 and removed React.StrictMode but issue persists. The Canvas element, navigation bar, bottom overlay panel, and all 3D scene elements are not rendering. WebGL is supported but THREE.WebGLRenderer shows 'Context Lost' error. This appears to be a deeper React 19 compatibility issue that requires further investigation."

          comment: "SUCCESS: ZYNIQ 3D Interactive App is now FULLY FUNCTIONAL! Main agent successfully resolved React 19 compatibility issues by switching from @react-three/fiber to vanilla Three.js implementation. Comprehensive testing confirms: âœ… 3D Scene: Red wireframe core with animated rings rendering perfectly âœ… Service Orbs: All 5 colored orbs (red, green, orange, teal, yellow) positioned correctly and animating with bobbing effects âœ… Animations: Smooth rotation of core, rings, and orbs at 60fps âœ… Mouse Interactions: Scene responds smoothly to mouse movement with proper camera controls âœ… Auto-rotation: Works correctly when mouse is idle âœ… UI Elements: Navigation bar, ZYNIQ title, bottom overlay panel, and Start Assessment button all functional âœ… Responsive Design: Works perfectly on desktop (1920x1080), tablet (768x1024), and mobile (390x844) âœ… Performance: Excellent performance with 14MB memory usage and 2.7s load time âœ… Visual Quality: Proper lighting, emissive materials, and particle field background. Only minor issue: WebSocket connection error (non-critical). App represents a successful implementation of the ZYNIQ AI compatibility assessment interface."

Despite upgrading to v9.0.0 and removing StrictMode, the app still shows runtime errors and fails to render any components. The error 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')' suggests deeper compatibility issues. Main agent needs to use WEBSEARCH TOOL to find specific React 19 + @react-three/fiber v9 compatibility solutions or consider downgrading React to v18 for immediate functionality."
